## **Hi! I’m Lakshita from Delhi, India.**

I am a B.Sc. Computer Science (Honors) graduate from Keshav Mahavidyalaya, University of Delhi. I enjoy exploring data to uncover meaningful insights. 
My interests lie in identifying patterns that can support better decisions and strategies across different domains.

On my GitHub, you’ll find projects where I experiment with data to uncover insights and tell stories through analytics. These projects reflect my learning journey and hands-on experience in working with data.

## Project 1: [TransactIQ – Forecasting India’s Journey Beyond Cash with UPI](https://github.com/lakshita-03/TransactIQ)
